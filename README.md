In your onboarding project, you'll receive additional details around the externship to better understand what you'll learn, program responsibilities, and an overview of your host company. Finish this project to get access to the rest of the platform.
Project Flow

We suggest you follow the project stages in order. Each stage prepares you for the next. You can preview future stages, but to move forward, you need to complete each stage in order.

Timing and Commitment

Use the project deadlines as your guide to stay on track. Each stage includes an estimated hours guide to help you plan your time.

Kick-off

You are viewing the onboarding project. Aim to finish this as soon as possible; we recommend finishing on the first day. Completing this will unlock access to the full platform and your main project.

Final Deliverable

Your final deliverable is to prepare an investment memo one-pager. You'll spend the final week crafting this deliverable, getting feedback, and practicing its presentation. If you've shown dedication, you might be chosen to present your work to top executives at the host company.
